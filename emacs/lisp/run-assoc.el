;;; run-assoc.el --- Run program or lisp function associated with a file.
;;
;; Filename: run-assoc.el
;; Description: Run program or lisp function associated with a file.
;; Authors: Emacs Wiki, pinetr2e, pft
;;
;;; Commentary
;;
;; run-assoc.el was tested with GNU Emacs 21.4 and 22.0.50.3 on debian linux.
;;
;; The idea and some portion of codes were borrowed from 'w32-browser'
;; which is only for w32 and from 'TrivialMode'.
;;
;; It is very simple to use:
;;
;; (require 'run-assoc)
;;
;; (setq associated-program-alist
;;    '(("gnochm" "\\.chm$")
;; 	("evince" "\\.pdf$")
;; 	("mplayer" "\\.mp3$")
;; 	((lambda (file)
;; 	   (let ((newfile (concat (file-name-sans-extension (file-name-nondirectory file)) ".txt")))
;; 	     (cond
;; 	      ((get-buffer newfile)
;; 	       (switch-to-buffer newfile)
;; 	       (message "Buffer with name %s exists, switching to it" newfile))
;; 	      ((file-exists-p newfile)
;; 	       (find-file newfile)
;; 	       (message "File %s exists, opening" newfile))
;; 	      (t (find-file newfile)
;; 		 (= 0 (call-process "antiword" file
;; 				    newfile t "-")))))) "\\.doc$")
;; 	("evince" "\\.ps$")
;;	("fontforge" "\\.\\(sfd\\(ir\\)?\\|ttf\\|otf\\)$")
;; 	((lambda (file)
;; 	   (browse-url (concat "file:///" (expand-file-name file)))) "\\.html?$")))
;;
;;
;;		Then, you can run the associated program in dired mode by
;;		Control-Return on a specific file or you can run the program
;;		directly by M-x run-associated-program
