(autoload 'csharp-mode "csharp-mode" "\
Major mode for editing C# code.

The mode provides fontification and indent for C# syntax, as well
as some other handy features.

At mode startup, there are two interesting hooks that run:
`prog-mode-hook' is run with no args, then `csharp-mode-hook' is run after
that, also with no args.

To run your own logic after csharp-mode starts, do this:

  (defun my-csharp-mode-fn ()
    \"my function that runs when csharp-mode is initialized for a buffer.\"
    (turn-on-font-lock)
    (turn-on-auto-revert-mode) ;; helpful when also using Visual Studio
    (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) ;; tabs are evil
    ....your own code here...
  )
  (add-hook  'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-fn t)


The function above is just a suggestion.


Imenu Integration
===============================

Check the menubar for menu entries for Imenu; it is labelled
\"Index\".

The Imenu index gets computed when the file is .cs first opened and loaded.
This may take a moment or two.  If you don't like this delay and don't
use Imenu, you can turn this off with the variable `csharp-want-imenu'.



Key bindings:
\\{csharp-mode-map}

\(fn)" t nil)

(if (fboundp 'register-definition-prefixes) (register-definition-prefixes "csharp-mode" '("c-looking-at-inexpr-block" "csharp-")))
