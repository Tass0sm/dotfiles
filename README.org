#+title: A Guix Home Environment

This is a work in progress reproducible home environment managed with [[https://sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/][Guix Home]]
by Andrew Tropin. Guix Home is set to be included with Guix 1.4, and I think
it's really neat.

* Elements
- WM : bspwm
- Bar : polybar
- Terminal: alacritty
- Shell : zsh
- Editor : Emacs v29 with =pgtk=, =xwidgets=, and =tree-sitter=.
